Aubrey Burl,harry aubrey woodruff burl ma dlitt phd fsa honfsa scot born september 24 1926 is a british archaeologist most well known for his studies into megalithic monuments and the nature of prehistoric rituals associated with them before retirement he was principal lecturer in archaeology hull college east riding of yorkshireburl has received a volume edited in his honour he has been called by the new york times the leading authority on british stone circlesburls work while considering the astronomical roles of many megalithic monuments is cautious of embracing the more tenuous claims of archaeoastronomy in prehistoric avebury burl proposes that circles and henge monuments far from being astronomical observatories for a class of astronomer priests were more likely used for ritualistic practices connected with death and fertility rites and ancestor worship similar to practices observed in other agricultural cultures in particular the rituals of native north american tribes such as the algonquin and the pawnee rituals would have been performed at key times of the year such as the spring equinox and summer solstice to ensure a successful harvest from the landhis approach led him to question what he sees as the overromanticised view that stonehenge was built from bluestones hauled by hand from the preseli hills in south west wales to salisbury plain rather the stones were left close to the site by earlier glaciers and then exploited by the monuments builders others have argued that the bluestones have been traced to only the preselli hills through their chemical signature and that they could not have come from elsewhere additionally it was claimed that there was no known glacier with a course linking the hills with salisbury plain or a glacier from anywhere that reached far enough south on the other hand recent research by earth scientists shows that glacier ice reached the scilly isles on at least one occasion and that ice which crossed pembrokeshire did cross the coasts of somerset and devon,Aubrey Burl,Aubrey Burl,4,6,4,user1,p2

margaret m dyson vision research institute at weill cornell silverman holds an ms in bioengineering from the polytechnic institute of new york and a phd in computer science from polytechnic university he is also a member of the research staff at the frederic l lizzi center for biomedical engineering riverside research institutesilverman is an internationally recognized leader in the field of ultrasound research especially highresolution imaging and bioeffectssilverman is a fellow of the american institute of ultrasound in medicine past president of the american society of ophthalmic ultrasound and is on the advisory boards of the national institutes of health transducer resource and the ocular oncology research society he has served on numerous grant review panels is a frequent reviewer for scientific journals and conferences has given many invited lectures and has often served as a moderator at scientific conferences silverman has helped pioneer the use of ultrasound in ophthalmology he developed a multivariate statistical model based on ultrasound spectral parameters to differentiate metastatic carcinoma and two subtypes of uveal malignant melanoma publication of these findings in 1983 represented one of the first reports in the literature of medical diagnosis based on multivariate statistical analysis and one of the earliest applications of ultrasound tissue characterization silverman was involved in the development of the use of highintensity ultrasound for treatment of glaucoma this project involved direction of an intense focused ultrasound beam at the region of the ciliary body to cause cyclodestruction this project eventually led to a commercial device sonocare inc manufactured under license by cornell and a multicenter clinical trial silverman was instrumental in compiling and providing statistical analysis of treatment results from over a thousand patients treated for refractory glaucoma by this device at over 20 centers the device became the first fdaapproved highintensity focused ultrasound hifu system several commercial hifu systems are now in clinical use although laser techniques based on this groundbreaking effort have supplanted this technique while working fulltime at cornell silverman spent his evenings studying computer science at polytechnic university for a phd following his interest in multivariate analysis he became interested in the then obscure field of neural networks simulated nonlinear interconnected processing units designed to perform pattern recognition in a manner loosely connected to how the brain performs such tasks silverman implemented a new technique called backpropagation as part of his dissertation he demonstrated how a multiscaled nonlinear neural net could be used for automatic pattern recognition to localize tumors in ultrasound bscans and then to access the underlying echo data and then perform a nonlinear multidimensional analysis to classify the tumor type this work represented the first use of neural nets in medical imaging and the first use of neural nets for medical diagnosis silverman received his doctorate for this work in 1990in the early 1990s silverman was instrumental in the development and clinical application of one of the first very high frequency ultrasound systems he developed a system for acquisition of a series of parallel scan planes with a 50 mhz transducer allowing 3d reconstruction of the anterior segment of the eye with an axial resolution of about 30 micrometres working with dan reinstein silverman developed software for processing 3d scans of the cornea that allowed measurement and mapping of corneal thickness as well as the thickness of the stroma and epithelium they also found that they could detect and measure the flap interface in lasiktreated eyes and demonstrated epithelial thickening associated with regions where the stroma had been ablated while a major achievement the linear 3d scan system could only obtain data in the 3 mm zone of the central cornea due to its specularity silverman then developed a new 3d scan system with 5degrees of freedom this system allowed the cornea to be scanned in a series of arcs such that the beam axis was maintained orthogonal to the corneal surface and the focal point maintained on the surface this system allowed demonstration of the importance of arcscanning for corneal analysis and led to the subsequent development of a far simpler arcscan device with just two programmable axes this system led to a commercial system artemis2 ultralink llc manufactured under license from cornell universitysilverman working with katherine ferrara now chair biomedical engineering uscdavis developed a new technique called swept mode for imaging of slow flow in the microvasculature this technique was demonstrated in the iris and ciliary body and was eventually patented silverman described the first use of 20 mhz ultrasound to obtain improved high resolution of retinal and choroidal pathologies such as nevii and small tumors in 2004,Ronald Silverman,Ronald Silverman,1,8,2,user4,p2
